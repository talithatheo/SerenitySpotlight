                                    injury of one’s own skin tissues usually without a suicidal intention, such as by scratching, biting,
                                    burning, cutting, or eating or drinking things that are poisonous. Self-harm is not a mental illness,

                            <p>Health condition affecting mental and daily function.</p>
                            <div class="read-more-cont">
                                <p>Mental disorder, also referred to as mental illness, are behavioral or mental patterns that cause
                                    significant distress or impairment of personal functioning. They are diagnosed by a trained health
                                    professional, such as a doctor, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist, using internationally
                                    established diagnostic criteria. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
                                    Fifth Edition (DSM-5) lists almost 300 different mental health disorders and organizes them
                                    into broader categories.</p>

                                <p>Mental disorders are viewed as irregularities or interruptions of the normal functioning of
                                    the mind or body. They may be caused by different factors, for example, genetic predispositions
                                    and family history of other diseases, traumatic life experiences, etc. But mental disorders
                                    can’t be detected by laboratory tests, and their symptoms vary widely and overlap considerably.
                                    For instance, depression and anxiety share the majority of symptoms and also tend to co-occur
                                    in what is called comorbidity.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Mental disorder disrupt a person’s life, adversely impacting their emotional, physical, and
                                    mental health and well-being. In most cases, symptoms of mental disorders can be effectively
                                    managed with a combination of medications and psychotherapy.</p>

                                    of sensations that are generally unpleasant and mainly arise from being consciously worried
                                    about the future, or afraid of an actual situation. Anxiety includes a variety of physical
                                    sensations that are linked with thoughts that make a person feel apprehensive or fearful
                                    about what’s to come. It’s a signal that we need to adapt to life’s challenges by learning
                                    how to cope. If anxiety is persistent or out of proportion to the situation, it can be
                                    a symptom of poor mental health.</p>

                            <p>Released in 2018 as part of her fourth album "Sweetener," this song was written by Ariana Grande, Savan Kotecha,
                                Peter Svensson, and Ilya Salmanzadeh. In an interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2018,
                                Ariana mentioned that the song was written to depict her state of anxiety. "Breathin is about breathing...
                                when you’re anxious. It’s about anxiety and feeling like you can’t get a full breath. It’s the worst feeling in
                                the world. This song is about that feeling," said Ariana Grande. Here’s a snippet of the lyrics:
                                "Some days, things just take way too much of my energy
                                I look up and the whole room's spinning"
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>6. Shawn Mendes - In My Blood</h2>
                            <p>"In My Blood" by Shawn Mendes talks about how he deals with anxiety. The song was written by Geoff Warburton,
                                Scott Harris, Shawn Mendes, and Teddy Geiger, who also produced it. It was the lead single from his third album,
                                "Shawn Mendes" (2018). "I know people who suffer from anxiety and find it a bit difficult to understand.
                                The whole reason I wrote this song is to like, ultimately, it’s not in my blood to do that (be anxious),"
                                said Mendes about the song. "In My Blood" was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2019 Grammy Awards.
                                Here’s a snippet of the lyrics:
                                "I'm overwhelmed and insecure,
                                give me something I could take to ease my mind slowly
                                Just have a drink and you'll feel better
                                Just take her home and you'll feel better
                                Keep telling me that it gets better
                                Does it ever?"

                            <h2>7. Lady Gaga - 911</h2>
                            <p> "911" is a song by Lady Gaga and is the eighth track on her album "Chromatica" (2020). It was written by Gaga along with Justin Tranter, BloodPop, and Madeon. In an Instagram post in September 2020, Lady Gaga acknowledged that the music video for "911" was her way of sharing her experiences with mental health. "This short film is very personal to me, my experience with mental health and how reality and dreams can interconnect to form heroes within us and around us," Gaga said. She also mentioned that the song is very honest about her mental health condition. Here’s a snippet of the lyrics:
                                "Turnin' up emotional faders
                                Keep repeating self-hating phrases
                                I have heard enough of these voices
                                Almost like I have no choice
                                This is biological stasis"
                            </p>

                            <h2>8. Jason Isbell – Anxiety</h2>
                            <p>"Anxiety" is a composition that addresses the impact of mental illness, particularly how those who suffer from it must also grapple with other people’s perceptions of their experiences. “I don’t have clinically diagnosed anxiety problems or paralyzing attacks where I can’t function,” said Isbell. “But I wanted to cover and represent that aspect in the song. So, I turned to my wife, who has more experience with these things, and we co-wrote the song. I wanted to be specific and depict people’s experiences when they have moments of disconnection from reality, and things get heavy. So, I consulted her about it.”
                            </p>

                            <h2>9. Blaine Larsen – How Do You Get That Lonely</h2>
                            <p> Written as a tribute and dedication to remembering Lance Emmitt who committed suicide at age 19, the lyrics reflect on the reasons behind how and why the boy made this decision. The song conveys the idea that a person's choice to end their life impacts more than just themselves; the entire community is negatively affected by this decision. "I got chills the first time I heard it, and I knew it was a song I had to cut," said Larsen. "I was deciding between a few songs for the record, choosing different ones, and I went home and received a lot of emails, one of which said, 'Your song prevented me from committing suicide.' I got emotional reading that email. It really opened my eyes to how a song can do that."
                            </p>

                            <h2>10. Tyler Joe Miller – Fighting</h2>
                            <p>"Fighting" emphasizes the message of taking life one day at a time, a mantra for many people regardless of their personal or professional situations. Miller said the song is “about revealing the skeletons in your closet and the demons under your bed that everyone has, and this song is about fighting yourself and your insecurities to overcome them and try to be a better person.” Since releasing the song in December 2020, Miller has received many messages from people sharing their personal stories and struggles. He added, “Fighting quickly stopped being about me and my story, and became about everyone who relates to it and writes their own struggles into it... Cutting through the BS and talking about real issues and struggles is hard, but I’m glad this song can help open up the conversation to break that stigma a bit. Remember, if you’re struggling, you’re in the majority.”
